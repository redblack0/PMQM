# TeX Beamer Template

This is a TeX Beamer template based on the HsH template. Reworked and made little changes
to make it more accessible. Included examples to demonstrate how one can utilise it.

Can recommend the TeX distribution linked below. It ships with PERL
and allows the use of the VSCode plugin to make the writing of TeX easier.
